<p align="center"><u>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</u></p>
Macbeth, <i><b>fully</i></b> The Tragedy of Macbeth, is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. 
It was probably <i><b>first</i></b> performed in 1606. It was <i><b>first</i></b> published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's <i><b>shortest</i></b> tragedy.

Macbeth is a Scottish general who has been fighting for King Duncan. 
Three witches tell Macbeth that he will become king of Scotland. Macbeth is spurred by his ambition and his wife, and he murders Duncan and accedes to the throne.
 His reign is <i><b>bloody and tyrannical</i></b> and ended by the combined forces of Scotland and England.

Shakespeare's main source for the story was Holinshed's Chronicles, particularly its accounts of Macbeth and Macduff and Duncan, 
but events in the play differ <i><b>extensively</i></b> from events involving the historical Macbeth.
 Events in Shakespeare's play are usually associated with Henry Garnet and the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.
